# Chess Game

This source code serves as the backbone for a fun and excited 2D chess game. 

Within this source code, you will find files that define the functionality for each piece and component of the game, the main file that runs the game, and the cmake files that enable you to run this game.

To play the game, you must run "Makefile" under cmake-build-debug, then "Final_Project". This will activate the game in your terminal.
